libarchive-based clients for XAD

# Current archive support
* RAR5
* Zip/ZipX

# Potential future archive support
* 7-Zip (replaces my custom 7-Zip client)
* XZ (replaces my liblzma XZ client)
* Any other libarchive-supporting formats that there are either no available client for or the one we have is outdated.
